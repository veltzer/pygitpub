- add a command "workflow_run_failing"
- add a command which checks that each repository that has a 'docs' subfolder also
	has github pages setup to the docs folder and vice versa: every repository
	on github which has github pages setup has a "docs" folder.
- improve the method 'yield_repos' to only make one function call and not two.
- add a "check description" and "fix description" to check the description on github is just
	like the description in the config/project.py
- allow to cleanup runs which were triggered by the user and not by a commit.
	(runs which you dont see a branch next to when you look at the "actions"
	page at github)
