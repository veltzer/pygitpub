- improve the method 'yield_repos' to only make one function call and not two.
- add a "check description" and "fix description" to check the description on github is just
	like the description in the config/project.py
- allow to cleanup runs which were triggered by the user and not by a commit.
	(runs which you dont see a branch next to when you look at the "actions"
	page at github)
