How should we tell pygitpub not to clone certain repos?

Why would we want that?
- repos are too big
- we have a list of repos we know we don't want (negative selection).
- we know which repos we need and don't need any other repos (positive selection).

Ideas
- parameter of list of repos we want
- parameter of list of repos we don't want
- regexp for repos we want
- file or folder on disk where we clone that says "don't clone me".

Which one is best?
I think the file is the best one since:
- you cant have a folder and a file with the same name in the same folder.
- you see which ones are files and which ones are folders and this tells you which repos
	are really clones and which ones are not.
