- when doing:
	$ pygitpub runs_cleanup
	I want to see only things getting cleaned by default
	and not all runs considered.
	have an options to see all runs considered too.
- add the ability to run all workflows.
- the command 'repos_list' does not list private repos
	add option to control that and also list private repos.
	make sure that this will also work for all other commands.
- add all github_*.sh functionality to this repo.
